# MultiplayerShooter
Game is currently unknown in what I want it to be, maybe a RPG? maybe a shooter? No idea.

Framework is simple.
Graphics and client is built with Pygame, all networking is done strictly with sockets. Game is very barebones but multiplayer is atleast working! 

# Todo
* Fix encryption from client-server
* Implement proper collisions & weapons that can shoot.
